## Genealogy Application for Joomla!

For genealogists and website builders who want to publish their genealogical data on the internet in a controlled and privacy safe way, the Joaktree component is an extension for Joomla! Content Management System, which allows you to easily synchronize your website with the genealogical data in your desktop application and puts you in the driver’s seat for controlling which information is published on the internet.

Niels van Dantzig

Joaktree has been brought up to date for use with the latest version of Joomla (Joomla 5.x) through the work of Robert Gastaud (https://www.robertg-conseil.fr/) and Pascal Leconte (https://www.conseilgouz.com/en/). Many thanks to them for their efforts in updating Niels van Dantzig’s code to the latest Joomla standards! This version of the Joaktree manual is based on the 2012 document originally created by Niels. It has been updated with procedures and screenshots that match the current versions of Joomla and Joaktree. At the time of writing the versions were:
- Joomla v 5.x.x
- Joaktree v 2.5.x

All screenshots were taken using the default Joomla templates:
- Site Template: Cassiopeia
- Administrator Template: Atum
